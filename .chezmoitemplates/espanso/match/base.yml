# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
#
imports:
  - "work/commands.yml"
  - "work/email.yml"

matches:
  # (w)ork (email)
  - trigger: ":wemail"
    replace: "conor.mcshane@yahooinc.com"

  # (p)ersonal (email)
  - trigger: ":pemail"
    replace: "conor.d.mcshane@gmail.com"

  # (g)ood (m)orning
  - trigger: ":gm"
    replace: "Morning all"

  # No swearing allowed
  - trigger: "fuck"
    replace: ""

  - trigger: "shit"
    replace: ""

  - trigger: ":test"
    replace: "hello from server"

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{ "{{mydate}}" }}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{ "{{output}}" }}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
